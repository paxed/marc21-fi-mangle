These scripts are used to grab the translated MARC21 biblio and authority
field descriptions from the Finnish National Library, and converted into
different formats for use in both Evergreen and Koha.

get_fi_xmls.sh will download the xml files and process them.

marc_warnings.pl will report MARC format errors in your database.
It uses the processed XML files for field repeatability and indicator checks.
